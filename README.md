# Project 1 - Hello Gazebo

Write a control program that drives the robot to the goal.

Drive the simulated robot from its starting position (-20, 0) to the goal position marked by the checkerboard pattern (20, 0).

This requires [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) and is intended to work on a
(non-virtualized) Ubuntu 20.04 or Debian 10 system.

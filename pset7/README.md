# Project 7 - Maze Pt. 3

Nicole Danuwidjaja

Write a control program that wanders a maze and generates a map.

Strategy: Based off Project 6's goals to generate a map visualization, the objective was to use A-star search algorithm to find the shortest path using a best-first search heuristic. Using the representation of the map, as the robot navigates through the maze, the best path is calculated based on the robot's location and how far away it is from the destination, while taking obstacles into account. Each Cell stores information about its parents and neighbors.

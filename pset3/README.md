# Project 3 - Land on the Mun

Build a custom rocket, launch it into space, transfer to Munar orbit, and land safely. Write a KerboScript program that automates the full Munar landing mission.

No YouTube video. This did not land on Mun.

Comments:
Was very stuck on how to successfully program the maneuver node. Resultantly, I spent the majority of my time trying to fix my code from that state and did not get to test out other areas of the program.

# Project 2 - Kerbal Space Program Rocket Launch

Write a control script using CX-4181 Scriptable Control System in KerboScript that will launch a Kerbal 1 Rocket into circular orbit. 

The goal is to reach an apoapsis of at least 100,000 meters, and a periapsis of similar magnitude. 

Ignite the rocket engines until apoapsis. Calculate the thrust against gravity, and calculate the angle of the rocket as it leaves the atmosphere.
